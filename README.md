## Project Overview
Employee attrition is a significant challenge for HR departments, impacting productivity and operational costs. This project aims to analyze attrition patterns, identify key factors influencing employee turnover, and provide actionable insights using SQL, Excel, and Power BI.

## Business Problem
- What factors contribute to employee attrition?
- How do salary, job satisfaction, and work-life balance impact retention?
- Can we predict which employees are at high risk of leaving?

## Dataset
The dataset consists of employee records with features such as age, job role, department, salary, work-life balance, job satisfaction, and attrition status.

Dataset Source: Kaggle

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL: Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation
- Excel: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), pivot tables, and additional calculations
- Power BI: Interactive dashboards for visualization

## Methodology
### Data Collection & Cleaning
- Imported the dataset into SQL for initial processing.
- Handled missing values and removed inconsistencies.
- Standardized column names for better readability.

### SQL Analysis
- Wrote complex SQL queries to:
  - Calculate attrition rates per department.
  - Analyze correlations between salary, job satisfaction, and attrition.
  - Identify high-risk employee profiles.

### Excel Processing
- Performed additional Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Created pivot tables and used statistical measures to validate findings.
- Applied formulas to derive new insights.

### Power BI Visualization
- Designed interactive dashboards to:
  - Show attrition trends by department, gender, and experience level.
  - Compare salary distributions between retained and exited employees.
  - Highlight key retention factors.

## Key Insights
- High Attrition Departments: Identified that Sales and IT have the highest turnover rates.
- Salary Impact: Employees with lower salaries showed a higher tendency to leave.
- Job Satisfaction: Employees with low satisfaction scores were more likely to leave.
- Work-Life Balance: Poor work-life balance was a major attrition driver.

## Challenges & Learnings
- Handling missing data and outliers required thorough data cleaning.
- Writing optimized SQL queries improved data retrieval speed.
- Building clear and insightful Power BI dashboards helped communicate findings effectively.

## Conclusion
By analyzing attrition trends, we provided HR teams with data-driven insights to enhance employee retention strategies. Predictive analytics can further help in identifying at-risk employees and implementing preemptive measures.
